nagioswidgets
=============

Post installation widgets for Nagios 3.x primarily focusing on increasing the appearance (in my opinion) and usability of the mostly excellent product Nagios 3.x


Header DooHickey
=============
Header DooHickey will take advantage of the (http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/cgiincludes.html) Nagios custom CGI headers and footers functionality to display information about a service or host that is not easily available.

i.e.
Check and Notification periods are 24x7 contacting admins Checks are every 5 mins. Alerts after 4 consecutive failed checks (at 1 mins interval retries)
